Take two strings s1, s2 including numbers or/and letters (a-z) or/and space with 2 string lengths are different. Write a program to create a string s3 that satisfies all of the following requirements: 

a) s3 is an ascending order 

b) s3 is the largest length string and includes distinguishing characters (no repeat) 

For example: 

s1 = "makeprogramminggreatagain", s2 = "sure,bosses" ---> The result:",abegikmnoprstu"

s1 = "thisis2ndexample\n\v\t", s2 = "yeah,iknow:p" ---> The result:",2:\adehiklmnopstvwxy"
